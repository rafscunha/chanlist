# Double Chain List

This repository is a part of review about data structs
Here i implemented the double chain list, and the methods to provide the FIFO and LIFO, improvement the original code to use template .
I also implemented a simples sort algorithm and a find method, passing a lambda function to compare the values, same works in JavaScript with Array.find and Array.sort
